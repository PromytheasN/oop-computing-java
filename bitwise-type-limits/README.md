# Assignment 1 – Bitwise Operations & Type Limits (Java)
*Course: CPSC 1181 – Object-Oriented Programming, Langara College*

This assignment showcases efficient use of [Java bitwise operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html) 
to calculate the minimum and maximum values for Java's primitive integer types. 
The logic is packaged in an interactive, menu-driven console application.

---

## Overview

The application:
- Computes **min/max values** for `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long` using pure bitwise logic
- Provides an interactive **text-based menu**
- Validates user input and handles errors cleanly
- Demonstrates low-level control and efficient coding practices

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Bitwise shifts and negation (`<<`, `~`) for binary manipulation
- Primitive type limits and overflow logic
- Java control flow and user input handling
- Clean procedural structure with separation of concerns

---

## File Contents

- `Assignment1.java` – Main source file with all logic
- `.classpath`, `.project` – Eclipse IDE config files
